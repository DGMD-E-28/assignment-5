# Battleship Game

## Assignment Overview
This project is part of **DGMD E-28: Developing Single Page Web Applications**. It focuses on building a simplified version of the classic Battleship game using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The goal is to demonstrate DOM manipulation, dynamic event handling, and structured logic using arrays and functions.

## Requirements

Technologies used:

- **HTML** to structure the grid and game controls
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for game logic, state tracking, and interactivity

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Game Setup

- Dynamically generate a **10x10 grid** of cells
- Each cell is clickable and represents part of the game board
- Ships are placed randomly on the grid via a JavaScript array

### ðŸ”¹ Game Logic

- Clicking on a cell checks if a ship is hit or missed
- Update the cell to display:
  - ðŸ’¥ Hit
  - ðŸŒŠ Miss
- Keep track of the number of ships hit

### ðŸ”¹ Victory Condition

- Player is alerted when all ships are sunk

## ðŸš€ Deliverables

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection Questions

1. **What was the most challenging part of this assignment?**  
   Creating a random yet valid ship placement without overlapping cells.

2. **What was the most satisfying part?**  
   Watching the game come to life and seeing hits and misses register in real timeâ€”especially when testing the win condition!
